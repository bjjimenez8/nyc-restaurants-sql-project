# NYC Restaurants SQL Project

This project explores a dataset of New York City restaurants (`nomnom`) using SQL queries.

## What I practiced
- Selecting and filtering data from a table
- Using DISTINCT to find unique values
- Filtering with WHERE, AND, OR
- Pattern matching with LIKE
- Sorting results with ORDER BY
- Limiting output rows with LIMIT
- Working with NULL values
- Categorizing data with CASE statements

## Files
- **restaurants.sql** – Contains all 12 task queries and solutions.

## Purpose
This project is part of my SQL learning path and demonstrates foundational query-writing skills used in data analysis, business intelligence, and database work.
